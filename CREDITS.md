## Institutions

    The code (VENUS, then NEXUS, then EPOS) was developed at the following institutions:

         * Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), USA 
         * CERN, Switzerland
         * University of Heidelberg, Germany 
         * SUBATECH, University of Nantes – IN2P3/CNRS – IMT Atlantique, France 
         * Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany
         * Warsaw University of Technology, Poland (PhD project)
         * Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kiev, Ukraine (PhD project)
         * Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile

## EPOS contributors

    The current EPOS code still contains quite some pieces from its
    predecessors NEXUS and VENUS, therefore the corresponding developers
    are still important contributors to the EPOS project.

          * Klaus WERNER (EPOS coordinator and founder, EPOS4 developer, NEXUS, VENUS)
          * Damien VINTACHE (Graphics, installation)
          * Johannes JAHAN (Susceptibilities, analysis, Rivet-EPOS interface)
          * Benjamin GUIOT(EPOS3, heavy flavor) 
          * Gabriel SOPHYS (EPOS3, analysis) 
          * Tanguy PIEROG (Cosmic Ray application, EPOS LHC, EPOS3) 
          * Sergej OSTAPCHENKO (NEXUS, pQCD part)
          * Michael HLADIK (NEXUS Metropolis
          * Hajo DRESCHER (NEXUS string decay)
          * Iurii KARPENKO (Hydro module)
          * Maria STEFANIAK (EoS module) 
          * Sarah PORTEBOEUF (Hard processes hadronic cascade)
          * Marcus BLEICHER (Hadronic cascade)
          * Jan STEINHEIMER (Hadronic cascade)

## Collaborators

    There are a couple of projects connected to EPOS, as EPOS+HQ (heavy
    quarks) and EPOS+PHSD, involving

          * Pol-Bernard GOSSIAUX (EPOS+HQ)
          * Joerg Aichelin (EPOS+HQ)
          * Elena BRATKOVSKAYA (EPOS+PHSD)
          * Mahbobeh JAFARPOUR (EPOS+PHSD)

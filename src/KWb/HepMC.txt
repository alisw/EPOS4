From EPOS, we provide the following information to the "header" of each event
(if an information is not written in this list here, then it is not provided
 from EPOS so it is just left defined by default / = 0)

- in 'E' line :
	~ number of vertices in the event

- in 'C' line :
	~ the corresponding p-p cross-section for the energy of the collision generated

- in 'H' line (if heavy-ion collision) :
	~ the number of participants from the projectile (according to Glauber calculations, NOT the real number from the simulation)
	~ the number of participants from the target     (according to Glauber calculations, NOT the real number from the simulation)
	~ the number of NN collisions                    (according to Glauber calculations, NOT the real number from the simulation) 
	~ the number of neutron spectators   (including the diffractive nucleon states)
	~ the number of proton spectators    (including the diffractive nucleon states)
	~ the impact parameter

/!\ WARNING : the number of spectators is directly coming from the simulation itself, while 
    the number of participants is coming from Glauber calculation and not from the simulation  
    =>  (n_spec + n_part) is NOT equal to (A_proj + A_targ)


If the event has been simulated in a different frame than the one wanted for the record in the .hepmc file
(e.g. p-Pb collisions that is simulated in center-of-mass frame but wanted in the lab frame for RIVET analysis),
one needs to add in the .optns file the command "set ihepframe 1".
It will then calculate, in the lab frame, the recorded event(s) particles coordinates that has been simulated in the 
center-of-mass frame. The rapidity boost of the center-of-mass in comparison with the lab frame is defined in the 
.optns file by the command "set rapcms dy", dy being a value (-0.468 for p-Pb collisions at LHC).

All events start with the original vertex of the collision, defined at space-time coordinates (0,0,0,0).
The 2 first particles listed then are the beam particles.

They are followed by all the spectators, remaining unchanged from their initial trajectory, and the 
diffractive proton and neutron states (sum of both should be equal to the numbers of spectators indicated 
in the 'H' line) ; all of them are considered as outgoing from the initial vertex.

Then, not all the rest of the event is registered in the .hepmc output. Depending on the value of the variable 
"which_table", are recorded :
 = 1 : only final-state particles, regardless of who are their parents 
 = 2 : all final-state particle + their ancestors when they're originating from weak and EM decays 
	(most of the strong decays are ignored, except some exceptions listed below)
 = 3 : only particles before hadronic cascades, i.e. just after hadronisation of the core + corona strings fragmentation
	(/!\ works ONLY if hadronic cascades were activated, recording then particles with ist = 3 in EPOS)

To do so for the case 2, the particle list is browsed (ordered following their creation time during the event), and 
ONLY the non final-state (FS) particles which decay with a lifetime tau > e-19s are recorded, the ones with tau < e-20s 
are ignored. Hence, the eta meson is the shortest-lived particle to have its decay recorded, and the Sigma0 baryon the 
longest-lived particle to be ignored.

However, there is a list of exceptions, i.e. particles with tau < e-20s that are recorded anyway (this list "excptn_list" 
is modifiable directly by hand in KWb/fill_hep.cpp, based on EPOS IDs of particles listed in KWt/idt.dt).
Here are the ones included for the moment (commonly studied quarkonia) :
 - J/Psi
 - Psi(2S)/(3770)
 - Upsilon(1S)/(2S)/(3S)/(4S)

Starting from a non FS particle which has its decay recorded (and which will be considered as outgoing particle of 
the initial vertex, even if it doesn't originates from initial interactions), all the children particles and their 
decay products will be recorded too, decay after decay, until reaching the FS descendants.

All the intermediary particles (non FS particles recorded because they decay weakly/EMly or are exceptions, or because 
they are children of such particles) are recorded with a status = 2.

/!\ WARNING : in case a non FS particle is registered but its children cannot be found, the particle is then recorded 
	with a status = 12, which is not defined in the standard HepMC ('12' because it should be '2',but ends up
	being like '1' as children are not found).
	Such situation should not happen, but "better safe than sorry".  

Finally, are also recorded all the FS particles (with a status = 1, indeed), considered as outgoing from the 
original vertex if they are not coming from recorded decays.

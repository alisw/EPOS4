UPDATE : 28/10/2021 (J.Jahan)
-> EPOS v.3437

The issue found here are inherited from previous modifications toward decays :
 => READ "UPDATE : 06/09/2021" 

Some partons are still found in final state because of impossible decays. It concerns in particular the 
following channels (= it has been seen for sure for these channels) :
- 446 -> (gamma) q aq 4 -4
- 447 -> gamma q aq 4 -4
- 550 -> q aq 5 -5
- 551 -> gamma q aq 5 -5

It seems that the problem comes from the fact that even though energy is conserved when considering 
masses of the quarks involved, energy conservation is actually violated when considering masses of the 
mesons that can be formed from those quarks. 

To solve the issue, all following channels has been removed :
44x / 55x -> [..] 4 -4 / [..] 5 -5

The partons that will bind together are the ones that follow each other in the definition of the 
decay channel (known from T. Pierog), e.g. in the following case :
"X -> q_i aq_i q_j aq_j"
the only mesons that can be formed are (q_i aq_i) and (q_j aq_j) mesons.

Hence, in order to allow all possible mesons formation from these decays, all possible configurations of 
partons have been considered, i.e. both :
"X -> q_i aq_i q_j aq_j" 
"X -> q_j aq_i q_i aq_j"

This modification has also been applied to some other channels implying decays into gluons, like :
- 557 -> 556 g g


The same issue of quarks in the final state was found in the decay of Lambda_c+ (2140)
 => READ "UPDATE : 26/08/2021"

To solve it, decay channels had been re-written neglecting the partons produced by the decay of the W+ 
boson. Thus, the decay channels are just made of a quark + diquark, and more specifically keeping the 
u & d quarks (1 & 2) but changing c quark (4) into a d or s quark (2 or 3), because of the weak decay.

It leads to 2 possible combinations : (1 2 3) or (1 2 2), used to build all possible configurations
of q + dq then, e.g. for the (1 2 2) combination :
- 2140 -> 1 2200
- 2140 -> 2 1200
- 2140 -> 2 2100


/!\ IMPORTANT : all those solutions, in particular about the treatment of quarkonia decays, are intended
                to be temporary and would require a more consistent treatment in the future, e.g. using 
                string decays

UPDATE : 06/09/2021 (J.Jahan)
-> EPOS v.3432

As gluons were found in the final-state particles list, all decays leading to a gluon have been modified
such that each gluon has been replaced by 1 quark-antiquark pair (obviously both of the same flavour).

The flavour considered was checked to respect the kinematics : sum(M(q/aq)) < M(mother particle) ;
each flavour has been used with an equivalent weight compared to the other ones.

As it is impossible to define a channel with 6 children, the bRatio("X => g g g") value was added to 
the bRatio("X => g g") value, which channel has thus been modified to "X => q_i aq_i q_j aq_j" 
(i,j : flavour indices).

This channel eventually had to be removed from the light mesons decay, because there is no phase space 
for a 4-body decay. Hence, for 706, 714 and 732, the channel "X => g g" was changed to "X => q_i aq_i".

  Particles not defined neither in PDG nor Pythia, but decay definitions were wrong (lack of 1 quark).

           => u  ad   ub    was corrected by   1160 (=> W+ u ub) => u  ad   u ub
  bRatios are shared following the W+ bRatios, which decays with a weight proportionnal to :
   - 1 for each of the 3 leptonic flavours (because of lepton flavour universality)
   - 3 * |Vqq|^2 (3 because of colour, |Vqq| being the elements of the CKM matrix) for each of 
     the 6 possible quark-antiquark decays involving u, d, s, c & b quarks
  Then, because of unitarity of the CKM matrix, sum(|Vuq|^2) = sum(|Vcq|^2) = 1 so the 
  hadronic decay weight is equal to sum(3*|Vuq|^2) + sum(3*|Vcq|^2) = 6.
  This leads to a total hadronic bR_h = 6 / (6+3) = 66.66%, and a total leptonic bR_l = 3 / (6+3) = 33.33%.
  As a consequence : 
   - bR_e = bR_mu = bR_tau = bR_l / 3 = 11.11%.
  Eventually, the only W+ quark-antiquark decays used are the W+ -> (u ad) / (c as) decays, because 
  |Vud| = 0.9737 & |Vcs| = 0.987 while all other ones are < 0.3 so can be neglected. 
  Hence :
   - bR_ud = bR_h * |Vud|^2 / (|Vud|^2 + |Vcs|^2) = 32.88%
   - bR_cs = bR_h * |Vcs|^2 / (|Vud|^2 + |Vcs|^2) = 33.78%
